        question: "How do you screen your caregivers?",
        answer: "Every caregiver undergoes a rigorous 5-step screening process: comprehensive background check (criminal + DMV), identity verification, reference checks from previous employers, skills assessment, and a personal interview. We also require current CPR/First Aid certification and ongoing training.",
        category: "Safety"
    },
    {
        question: "What if I don't like the caregiver you match me with?",
        answer: "No problem. Our AI matching is highly accurate (94% first-match success rate), but if you're not completely satisfied, you can request a new match at any time—no questions asked, no fees. We'll even schedule video interviews with up to 3 candidates so you can choose the best fit.",
        category: "Matching"
    },
    {
        question: "Is my parent's personal information secure?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We're HIPAA-compliant and use bank-level encryption (AES-256) for all data. Caregivers only see the information they need for care—full medical history and sensitive documents stay private and accessible only to you through your secure dashboard.",
        category: "Privacy"
    },
    {
        question: "Can I change or cancel care anytime?",
        answer: "Yes. There are no long-term contracts or cancellation fees. You can modify schedules, change caregivers, or pause service with just 24 hours notice. You're in complete control of your care.",
        category: "Flexibility"
    },
    {
        question: "How much does it cost compared to traditional agencies?",
        answer: "In Santa Clara County, traditional agencies typically charge $32-42/hour while paying caregivers only $18-22/hour. With CareConnex, families pay $22-28/hour directly—caregivers earn more (typically $20-26/hour), and families save 30-40%. No agency markup, no hidden fees, no long-term contracts.",
        category: "Pricing"
    },
    {
        question: "What types of care do you offer?",
        answer: "We offer comprehensive in-home care: companionship, personal care (bathing, dressing, grooming), meal preparation, medication reminders, transportation, light housekeeping, dementia/Alzheimer's care, respite care for family caregivers, and overnight or 24/7 live-in care.",
        category: "Services"
    },
    {
        question: "How quickly can I get a caregiver?",
        answer: "Most families find a match within 24-48 hours. For urgent needs, we have a network of pre-approved caregivers who can often start same-day. The sooner you complete your care profile, the faster we can find your perfect match.",
        category: "Timing"
    },
    {
        question: "What happens if a caregiver calls in sick?",
        answer: "We've got you covered. Our platform automatically notifies you and suggests backup caregivers from your area who are available. For recurring care, we recommend having a primary and backup caregiver to ensure continuity.",
        category: "Reliability"
